//! Generic Postgres-claim worker-pool runtime. Generalizes the proven
//! sync_queue pattern (claim-with-lease + backoff + give-up) so enrich and all
//! catalog discovery run as `WorkSource` instances over one substrate.
//!
//! Invariants the substrate guarantees:
//! - attempts increment at CLAIM (same UPDATE that sets the lease) → a claimed
//!   row instantly has a positive backoff window; the attempts=0 republish loop
//!   cannot be expressed.
//! - a dedicated lease column self-expires on crash (cutoff in SQL via DB clock)
//!   → no reaper, in-flight/success/failure are distinguishable.
//! - an explicit terminal state at the attempt cap → the working set shrinks
//!   monotonically.
//!
//! No pooled DB connection is held across `run()` (external I/O); claim and the
//! per-item terminal write are separate short transactions.
